                    After multiple conflicts in Afghanistan, many kids are left without parents, and widows are left in situations where
                    they can't feed their kids. With $10 you can support an orphan for a whole week

                    This verse tells metaphorically the reward for charity. Giving one dollar to Sadaqah brings multiple rewards. The
                    Sadaqah has a positive effect on the recipient as one dollar is transferred sequentially to the benefit of others. The
                    verse tells us that everything we offer has the ability to increase 700 times. This means that the return on investment
                    is 700%.
                    
                    The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in
                    each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and
                    Knowing. (Surah Al-Baqarah, 261).
